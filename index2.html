    <h1 class="sections" id="section1">About</h1>
    <p id="ab" style="display: none;">The idea of establishing Al Ahly came in the first 10 years of the 20th century and was firstly raised by Omar Lotfy who was a student in the Egyptian Law School during his presidency of the High School Students Club, which was established in 1905.
        The establishment of a club for high school students was for political reasons, and the students needed a sports club to gather them for leisure and exercise.
        He discussed the idea of establishing the club with a group of friends who were enthusiastic about it, and in 1907 Al Ahly was established.
        Talaat Harb, president of the Bank of Egypt, contributed £E100 to the establishment of the club.
        The club was first headed by Alfred Mitchell-Innes, who was a British advisor to the Ministry of Finance at the time, in order to facilitate financial support for the club.
        An official meeting of the club's board was held on 24 April 1907. The committee met at 5:30 pm in the house of Mitchell-Innes in Giza under his chairmanship and the membership of Idris Ragheb Bey, Ismael Seri Pasha, Amin Sami Pasha, Omar Lotfi Bek and Mohamed Effendi Sherif as secretary.
        After the establishment of the club was approved, the main building was designed by architect Ismail Seri, and revised by Mitchell-Innes. A civil company on behalf of Al Ahly Sports Club was established.
        Shares of the company were worth £E5 each, and it was the goal of the club when it was established to raise £E5,000. Only £E3,165 were collected over a year, which was not enough.
        This forced the club to borrow £E1,000 from the National Bank of Egypt in March 1908 by Omar Sultan and Idris Ragheb and Talaat Harb contributed £E100 to the establishment of the club.
        The first honorary president of the club was the Minister of Education Saad Zaghloul.
        The name of Al Ahly Sporting Club was suggested by Amine Samy Amin, to serve the students and graduates of high schools who were the mainstay of the revolution against the British occupation.
        On 2 April 1908, Mitchell-Innes stepped down as president of the club. Aziz Ezzat was appointed as the new president and became the first Egyptian president of Al Ahly. The official opening ceremony of the club was held in its main building on 26 February 1908.
        Mokhtar El Tetsh, one of the club legends, is the namesake of the club's old stadium and current training ground
        The game of football was not one of the goals of the founders of Al Ahly club, but rather to open its doors to students of higher schools to meet and practice political dialogues. However, the graduates of high schools who were members of the club fell in love with football, which prompted Ahly to build the first stadium in 1909. At the time , they called it Al-Hawsh; colloquially meaning the courtyard in Egyptian Arabic. 
        The stadium was improved over the years, eventually becoming Mokhtar El-Tetsh Stadium.
        The first official football team was established in 1911. The team was primary and secondary school players who played football ball in Al-Hawash, which was established in 1909 in the club's land. The names of the first players of Al Ahly were as follows: Hussain Higazi, Abdel Fattah Taher, Fouad Darwish, Hussein Mansour, and Ibrahim Fahmy.
        The star of this team was the striker Hussein Hegazi.
        In 1915, Al Ahly made tours of Egyptian cities to play matches and to spread football and its culture. Al Ahly played in Alexandria, Port Said, Assiut, and Ismailia. The team, led by the star Hussein Hegazy, faced many teams, including foreign teams belonging to the British army, which increased the popularity of Al Ahly and the new game in Egypt.
        Ahly contributed with Zamalek SC, El Sekka El Hadid SC in the formation of the first football team of Egypt to participate in the Olympic games 1920. The club also contributed to the establishment of the Egyptian Football Association. In 1923, Al Ahly played an active role in the establishment of the Egyptian Tennis Federation.
